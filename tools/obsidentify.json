  "description_full": "Recognize nature in one click! Take a photo in Europe or the Dutch Caribbean and find out which species it is. Collect all your wildlife observations in the app. You'll be rewarded with tips to find new species, earn badges, and be invited to join challenges. Create groups with colleagues, family or friends, to share your stunning nature observations. Your observations, and those of others, contribute to biological research and knowledge about nature. Every observation counts!\n\nObsIdentify only recognizes wild animals, plants and mushrooms in Europe and the Dutch Caribbean. Please do not use the app for selfies, people, pets, house or garden plants.\n\nObsIdentify, like it's web portals Observation.org, Waarnemingen.be and Waarneming.nl, uses the image recognition NIA (Nature Identification API) this is a Deep Learning model. After the user uploads the image, a team of human specialists checks if all identifications made by NIA are correct. Int his way the image recognition keeps on improving and extra species are added every year. ObsIdentify is an app focussing on the general public and enabling them to identify biodiversity in Europe (and the dutch carribeans) with a very simple and intuitive system. The app then stimulates users to learn more about species or discover more with gamification such as badges and challenges. These badges give specific tips based on the skill-level of the user for a certain species group. ObsIdentify also stimulates you to challenge friends with a grouping system.\nAll observations go to the nature databases of Observation.org where they can be freely accessed (unless the user specified otherwise or it is a sensitive species). The portal also has warning systems for invasive alien species so that farmers get a notification whenever a dangerous organism for their crops has been spotted in the vicinity or for nature conservationists to stem the flow of invasive alien species. All data is sent to GBIF (Global Biodiversity Platform) and is used for scientifc publications.",
