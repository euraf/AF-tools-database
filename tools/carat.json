  "description_full": "The CARbon Agroforestry Tool “CARAT” is an online tool developed by the Soil Service of Belgium (BDB), UGent and ILVO. It makes use of the software program R and is developed as an interactive app using the Shiny package. The primary goal of the CARAT tool is to support farmers, researchers and/or policy actors in quantifying carbon stocks of a specific AF field in temperate climatic conditions, and to predict how these stocks evolve over a period of 30 years. At present, the tool is aimed at simulating AF systems that consist of high pruned solitary trees. Choice between 20 different tree species is made possible. The user is provided with a field-scale map showing heterogeneities in SOC as a result of tree presence, as well as an estimation of above- and belowground carbon stocks at field level and their evolution with time.",
